# Vector-Database-with-Chroma-DB

Here's a concise summary and workflow of your project, "Building-a-Vector-Database-with-Chroma-and-LangChain-for-DocRetriever-from-ChromaDb-by-LLM":

### Project Summary:
The project aims to create a vector database using Chroma DB, integrate LangChain for document retrieval, and utilize Hugging Face's LLM models for query refinement. This setup allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and processing of document embeddings, enhancing search capabilities using pre-trained language models.

### Project Workflow:

1. **Setting Up Chroma DB:**
   - Chroma DB is used to store vector embeddings locally, providing an open-source alternative to cloud-managed solutions like Pinecone.
   - Installation involves pip installing Chroma DB and its dependencies.

2. **Loading Documents:**
   - Text documents are loaded using DirectoryLoader and TextLoader from LangChain, enabling batch processing of text data.

3. **Preprocessing Text Data:**
   - Documents are split into smaller segments using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to ensure compatibility with embedding models.

4. **Fetching Pretrained Embeddings:**
   - Hugging Face's SentenceTransformer is employed to convert unstructured text data into vector embeddings using pre-trained models like "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2".

5. **Storing Vector Embeddings:**
   - Vector embeddings of documents are stored in the local Chroma DB directory using Chroma's `from_documents` method.

6. **Querying and Retrieval:**
   - Chroma DB acts as a retriever to fetch relevant documents based on user queries using methods like `get_relevant_documents`.
   - Retrieval QA chains integrate Hugging Face's LLM models (e.g., "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct") to refine query responses from retrieved documents.

7. **Processing and Displaying Results:**
   - Results from LLM-refined queries are processed and displayed, including source document metadata to trace back the information.

8. **Cleaning Up:**
   - After use, the vector database collection is cleaned up by deleting and persisting the directory.

9. **Documentation and Further Resources:**
   - Links to Chroma DB's documentation and PyPI repository are provided for updates and detailed readings.

This workflow integrates various components seamlessly to facilitate efficient document retrieval and processing using local vector embeddings storage and cloud-based LLM models, ensuring flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness in data handling and querying tasks.
